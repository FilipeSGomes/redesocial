## API Endpoints
````markdown
POST /auth/login - Login into the App

POST /auth/register - Register a new user into the App
```

## Authentication
The API uses Spring Security for authentication control. The following roles are available:

```
USER -> Standard user role for logged-in users.
ADMIN -> Admin role for managing partners (registering new partners).
```
To access protected endpoints as an ADMIN user, provide the appropriate authentication credentials in the request header.

## Database
The project utilizes [PostgresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the database. The necessary database migrations are managed using Flyway.
